Before becoming a data scientist, I was a PhD student supervised by Edina Rosta
and Alessia Annibale at KCL. My complete research papers can be found on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vKNn-oYAAAAJ&hl=en).

During my time in academia, my research interests centred around understanding the dynamics of Markovian systems and their application to biophysical systems.

My PhD thesis can be found [here](/assets/kells_thesis.pdf).
