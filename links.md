Just a random selection of some of my favourite resources and talks.

## YouTube Videos

1. **Natural Intelligence is All You Need [tm]**
   - Channel: PyData
   - Thoughts: I really love this talk by Vincent Warmerdam. He talks about some things that have been on my mind for a while. In particular how in data science we often focus too much on tools and methods and not enough on the conversion of business problems into data science problems.

2. **Ok, Doomer**
   - Channel: PyData
   - Thoughts: This is a fantastic talk by Laura Summers on the trends in the conversations around the existential threat from AI. I've been kind of irritated by these topics for a while. All of sudden, tech billionaires are worried about "What if an LLM becomes sentient and decides to nuke us?!?!". It's crazy to me that the only way these people can imagine being harmed by AI is by some extinction event and not just the everyday algorithmic bias of facial recognition, predictive policing etc. Anyway, this talk is brilliant and everyone should watch it.
