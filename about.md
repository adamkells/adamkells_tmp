- For a copy of my CV, click [here](/assets/kells_cv.pdf)
- I currently work for data consulting company Artefact as a data science manager.
- Before that I spent two years developing causality techniques for time series at causaLens and a single year at the ill-fated furniture company MADE.com (RIP in peace).
- I earned my PhD in Biophysics from [Kings College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/index.aspx) in 2019 where I was supervised by
  [Edina Rosta](http://www.rostaresearch.com/) and
  [Alessia Annibale](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/alessia.annibale/web_page/).
- Before my PhD I previously graduated with a 1st Class BSc in Theoretical
  Physics from [UCD](http://www.ucd.ie/) in 2015 and a MSc (Distinction) in
  Non-equilibrium systems from [KCL](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/index.aspx) in
  2016.
- I taught Physical Chemistry tutorials at all undergraduate levels and
  was fortunate enough to be nominated for a teaching award in 2018.
- Outside of data science and work I mainly fuel my Crossfit addiction and watch an eclectic mix of films.
