## About

Hi there! I'm Adam and thanks for checking out my website!

I'm on a mission to make data science better for everyone. I think there's too many unreliable models and bad data out there and I want to be part of making it easier to build good solutions.

## Background

Currently I work as a data science (DS) manager at [Artefact](https://www.artefact.com/) in London. I manage and deliver DS projects in lots of different areas but my specialist subjects are time series forecasting and NLP.

Before my current role I led the data science team at MADE (RIP in peace) where I built a number of cool solutions (like a hierarchical time forecasting pipeline and a Bayesian framework for solving the cold start problem of new product pricing).

Before MADE, I worked at deeptech startup causaLens where I helped to engineer a product for automating causal discovery in machine learning.


I completed a PhD in Biophysics from [Kings College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/index.aspx) in 2019 where I published 9 papers in under 3 years. I was supervised by [Edina Rosta](http://www.rostaresearch.com/) and [Alessia Annibale](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/alessia.annibale/web_page/). My research focus was on using Markov modelling to understand protein dynamics. I developed a number of novel algorithms for automating this.

I graduated with a 1st Class BSc in Theoretical Physics from [UCD](http://www.ucd.ie/) in 2015 and a MSc (Distinction) in Non-equilibrium systems from [KCL](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/index.aspx) in 2016.

## Outside Work
Outside of data science I am really passionate about art in all it's forms. I love listening to music, watching films, reading books, going to the theatre, photography exhibitions, the list goes on! I'm hoping to add a section to the website at some point with my favourites. I also have a mild crossfit addiction.
